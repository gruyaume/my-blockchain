## Requirements

### Python version
Python 3.8

### Libraries
Install libraries with pip:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Unit tests
Run unit tests locally by running the following:
```bash
pip3 install tox
tox
```

## Integration tests
Integration tests allow to complete transactions from the wallet to the node.

1. Start the node's flask server:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=src/node/main.py
flask run
```

2. On another terminal window, run integration tests:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src
pytest integration_tests
```

Note that you can change the HTTP port that your flask app listens on by adding the `--port` option to `flask run`.
Example: `flask run --port 5002`

## New blockchain user 
In the current implementation there are 4 users of the blockchain: albert, bertrand, camille and the miner. To create a 
new user, you will have to generate a new public/private key pair. To do so, you can simply run the 
"new_user_creation.py" script inside of the `common` directory:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src
python src/common/new_user_creation.py 
```
The output will simply print you new public/private keys that you will be able to use
